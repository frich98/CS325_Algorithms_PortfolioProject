I am hosting my project on repl.it at the following url:

https://repl.it/@richertf/CS325PortfolioProjectrichertf

It is written in python, and the entire game play is on the console.

------------------------ TO PLAY THE GAME ------------------------

***** Note --- > in my PDF file, there are screenshots in the Appendix
if those are more helpful to follow than the text instructions
below.

1) Press the Run play button to run the program

2) Decide whether or not you want to use the hardcoded board
or make your own. If you decide to make your own, 
you will then be asked to input number of rows,
number of columns, and number of mines.
Your input will be verified before proceeding.

NOTE that I have decided to display the board game with all of the mines
displayed at the beginning of the game so you as the grader can ensure
the game is running as expected. Obviously, in a real game situationm,
this would be hidden and the user would have to start selecting cells
to see where the mines might be, but for grading purposes,
I thought this would be helpful to see. 

3) Now, you will start playing the game. To enter a cell to choose,
you will type the row,col onto the command line.
For example, if I wanted the cell in position 1,10 then I would type
1,10 onto the command line. The cells are 1-indexed in terms of user input.

4) The board will then update, and the updated board will be displayed
on the console. 

5) The game will continue asking you to input a cell and will continue
updating the board until you have either won (i.e. all non-Mine cells 
have been selected) OR you have lost (you selected a Mine cell).

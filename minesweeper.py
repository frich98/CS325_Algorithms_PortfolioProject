Problem # 11 Minesweeper is a popular computer puzzle game
that comes with some MicrosoftTM operating systems.
It is played on an m Ã— n grid of cells, all of which are initially hidden.
k mines are randomly distributed over the grid.
Clicking on a cell reveals its contents.
If the cell contains a mine then the game ends and the player loses.
If there is not a mine in the cell, a number is revealed (1..8
that corresponds to the number of adjacent
(horizontally, vertically or diagonally) cells that contain a mine.
If a cell does not contain a mine, and is not next to a mine,
a blank cell is displayed and other adjacent blank cells are also revealed.
The game ends when, either a mine is uncovered (a loss) or
all cells are revealed that do not contain a mine (a win).

The goal is to reveal all of the cells that do not contain a mine,
leaving the k cells that do contain a mine still hidden.
Deciding the solvability of Minesweeper has been shown
to be NP-Complete by Kaye (2000).
We can define l as the maximum number of mines that surround any cell,
and then general Minesweeper has l = 8.
DECISION QUESTION (Kaye, 2000):
Given an arbitrary set of mines and numbers on a rectangular grid, can
mines be placed consistently, following the usual minesweeper rules?

    This is the meat of the game, and the impoprtant part of updating

    go through those, adding their adjacent items, etc. etc. as appropriate
    until the list of adjacent items is empty and we have processed 
    all we can.
